- Add a load test for `$validate` in `jmeter/`: arrival rate driven scenarios (smoke, steady, ramp) that can target a
  locally built matchbox, the published matchbox-ch-elm image, or a remote instance with mutual TLS, reporting the
  server side validation time separately from HTTP latency and recording each run in a comparable history file
- Document the first load test findings in `jmeter/readme.md`: ParallelGC gives 29% more `$validate` throughput and
  45% lower p95 than G1 on the same hardware, throughput stops scaling past about four cores, and a larger heap
  does not help
- GUI: browse the FHIR package registry packages2.fhir.org on the IGs page, filtered by package name, FHIR version and
  publication date, mark the installed packages, and install a selected package version (hidden when the server is in
  httpReadOnly mode) (#583)
- Add the validator version to the validation OperationOutcome, as per the FHIR Tooling Extensions (#581)
- Add proposed profiles in the validator even if a `meta.profile` is present (#335)
- Add information about the proposed profiles in the validator: package ID and version, title, and canonical URL (#355)
- Allow filtering proposed profiles by current version (#355)

2026/09/14 Release 4.1.16

2026/09/11 Release 4.1.15

- Fix reading a conformance resource (StructureMap, StructureDefinition, ...) by the string id it was created with,
  which failed with a 500 because the id was always parsed as a number; an unknown id now returns a 404 (#573)
- Fix debug mode of the $transform operation (#572)
- GUI: ask the engine to analyze Bundle documents for possible validation profiles (#355)
- GUI: fix the XML syntax highlighting
- GUI: fix the XML resource data extraction
- Update to HAPI FHIR 8.12.0
- Fix the MCP server tool declarations
- Fix the resolution of unversioned canonicals in the validation engines copied from the main engine: the copy of
  the context lost the package dependencies and the preference for the core package definitions, so the latest
  version of a resource was used (e.g. the R5 CodeSystem `http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter-status` from
  hl7.fhir.uv.xver-r5.r4 instead of the R4 one), which rejected the code `finished` of `Encounter.status` (#538)
- Update org.hl7.fhir.core to 6.10.4
- Allow matching document Bundle by their Composition type code, without Composition category code (#355)

2026/08/31 Release 4.1.14

- Try to parse the LLM providers' JSON error responses to provide more meaningful error messages (#531)
- Mark logical models as profiles that can be used in validations (#446)
- Fix StructureMap/$list returning empty when using onlyOneEngine mode (#472)
- Make StructureMap/$transform always available, not only on onlyOneEngine mode (#428)
- Fix StructureMap/$transform not reading the `source` parameter from the Parameters body
- Fix the rendering of the StructureMap/$transform operation in the GUI
- Don't copy the suppressedWarnInfos/suppressedErrors from the main engine to the validation engines (#539)
- Allow using an FML file as a map for StructureMap/$transform in the GUI (#560)
- Remove the configuration property `matchbox.fhir.context.analyzeOutcomeWithAI` (#561)
- Remove the configuration property `matchbox.fhir.context.analyzeOutcomeWithAIOnError` (#561)
- Add the configuration property `matchbox.fhir.validation.analyzeErrorsWithLlm` (#561)
- Add the configuration property `matchbox.fhir.mcp.requestAnalysisFromClient` (#561)
- Allow to override `llmProvider` in the validation GUI
- Revert the temporary workaround for "Slicing cannot be evaluated" in `ProfileUtilities.findProfile()` (#487); the canonical version resolution rules are honoured again, as org.hl7.fhir.core 6.10.0 resolves versioned extension canonicals correctly
- Fix national core IGs (`hl7.fhir.fr.core`, `hl7.fhir.us.core`, ...) failing to resolve because they were treated 
  as FHIR core packages and looked up on the classpath (#568). Thanks @achrafachkari!
- Support R4 StructureMaps in $transform (#559)
- Fix support of StructureMaps with pinned-version targets (#431)
- When an ImplementationGuide is uninstalled, evict all cached engines that loaded it (#322)
- Add a `META_VERSION` column to `MB_INSTALLED_STRUCT_DEF`, defaulting to `1`, to allow future data migration
- Add `DOC_COMP_TYPE_CODE` and `DOC_COMP_CAT_CODE` columns to `MB_INSTALLED_STRUCT_DEF`, storing the Composition 
  type and category codes when the current profile is a document Bundle making direct use of that Composition.
- Add the `Bundle/$get-profiles` to infer possible validation profiles for a document Bundle, based on its Composition
  type and category codes (#355)
- Don't keep the narrative of resources loaded in the engine context (#566). Thanks @achrafachkari!
- Add custom metrics
- Update org.hl7.fhir.core to 6.10.3

2026/08/14 Release 4.1.13

- Force Spring Data to 3.5.12 (`spring-data-commons`, `spring-data-jpa`, `spring-data-envers`), which HAPI FHIR still pulls in as 3.3.5, to fix three vulnerabilities in `spring-data-commons`: CVE-2026-41716 (denial of service, attacker-supplied strings are permanently retained as property-lookup cache keys and can exhaust the heap), CVE-2026-41711 and CVE-2026-41721
- Align `spring-core` and `spring-websocket`, which HAPI FHIR pulls in as 6.2.18, with the Spring Framework version already used elsewhere (6.2.19), fixing CVE-2026-41838 in `spring-websocket` and CVE-2026-41848 in `spring-core`
- Force `spring-retry` to 2.0.13, which HAPI FHIR pulls in as 2.0.10, to fix CVE-2026-41710
- Fix the GUI not displaying markdown content (#555)
- Isolate each database write during the migration of `MB_INSTALLED_STRUCT_DEF`

2026/08/11 Release 4.1.12

- Update org.hl7.fhir.core to 6.10.0
- Added the parameter `matchbox.fhir.context.ssrfProtectionEnabled` to control the new HAPI SSRF protection mechanism (Important: if you use a local terminology server you need to put that parameter)
- Update HAPI FHIR to 8.10.1
- Fix the GUI not able to send resources larger than 64 KiB (#542)
- Fix `Ambiguous type id` validation errors: the FHIR core package of another FHIR version (e.g. `hl7.fhir.r5.core#5.0.0` for an R4 validation) is no longer loaded when it is declared as a dependency of an IG, matching the behaviour of the FHIR validator
- Fix requests larger than 2 MiB being rejected by Undertow (`UT000020`): the maximum request body size is now 100 MB, configurable with `server.undertow.max-http-post-size` (#543)
- Update hl7.terminology to 7.3.0 and hl7.fhir.uv.extensions to 5.3.0. Note that 5.3.0 widens the context of some extensions, e.g. `patient-citizenship` is now allowed on `Patient`, `RelatedPerson` and `Person`; validations that expected an `Extension_EXTP_Context_Wrong` error for these extensions will no longer report it
- Fix `java.lang.Error: failed to validate, but no errors` when validating a bundle whose entry slice allows several profiles and that contains a reference to another bundle entry (#543): with `showMessagesFromReferences` (enabled by default in matchbox), warnings and hints from the referenced resource, such as the `dom-6` best practice warning, no longer make the referring resource fail validation
- Optimize listing validatable profiles by caching them to a new database table. It will be automatically created on the first startup after the update.
- Fix copy() aliasing bug in StructureMap transforms (#552) thanks @mrunibe for PR's !
- Upgrade Spring Boot from 3.5.14 to 3.5.16, which brings Micrometer 1.15.12 to fix two DoS vulnerabilities in `micrometer-core` (CVE-2026-40983 via specially crafted gRPC requests, CVE-2026-40984 via specially crafted HTTP requests)
- Fix the unit tests being killed by the OOM killer on the CI runner: the forked test JVMs were allowed to grow to 100% of the machine's memory (`-XX:MaxRAMPercentage`), so the garbage of the already-dirtied Spring test contexts was never reclaimed; the heap is now capped at 70% in both modules, and the Maven processes of the unit and integration test workflows are sized down so they cannot claim the memory the test JVMs need

2026/07/01 Release 4.1.11

- Fix for issue #528: Validation through MCP with AI analysis via Sampling will only get the result of the AI analysis back, not the full OperationOutcome
- Update org.hl7.fhir.core to 6.9.11
- Frontend maintenance: upgrade to Angular 22, replace unmaintained dependencies

2026/06/08 Release 4.1.10

- Validation requests through MCP will no longer invoke a separate LLM for AI analysis. Instead matchbox will give the Operation Outcome together with a prompt back to the MCP client.
- MCP sampling enabled. If client supports sampling, the AI analysis will get performed by the clients LLM.

2026/05/27 Release 4.1.9

- Upgrade Undertow from 2.3.24.Final to 2.4.1.Final to fix DoS via multipart/form-data parsing on HTTP GET requests (CVE-2026-3260). Since Undertow 2.4.0 the servlet and websocket modules were extracted to `io.undertow.ee` (UNDERTOW-2646); we now use `io.undertow.ee:undertow-servlet:1.0.0.Final` and `io.undertow.ee:undertow-websockets:1.0.0.Final` for Jakarta EE 10 compatibility (Spring Framework 6.2).
